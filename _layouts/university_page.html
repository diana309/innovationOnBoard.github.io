        Innovation OnBoard is a student-led entrepreneurship program featuring
        bi-weekly seminars and workshops, culminating in a premier venture
        competition where teams compete for cash prizes. We foster innovation
        by providing a forum to build cohesive, multidisciplinary teams,
        simplify the entrepreneurial experience, and launch new ventures.
